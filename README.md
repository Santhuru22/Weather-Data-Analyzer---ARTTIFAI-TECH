# Weather-Data-Analyzer---ARTTIFAI-TECH
Project Idea:
📊 Weather Data Analyzer - Bangladesh Weather Data
Developed for ARTTIFAI TECH Data Science Internship

This project analyzes historical weather data from Bangladesh using Python, focusing on climate trends and future temperature forecasting with machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, visualizations, and predictive modeling using Linear Regression.

🔍 Project Objective
To build a Weather Data Analyzer that:
Processes real-world weather data (CSV from Kaggle)
Visualizes temperature, humidity, and rainfall trends
Predicts future temperatures using Linear Regression
Offers statistical insights for researchers and weather analysts

🧠 Key Features
✅ Data Collection & Preprocessing
Loaded CSV weather dataset (Bangladesh)
Converted dates, extracted year/month
Filled missing values (mean imputation)
Normalized and cleaned for modeling

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Line Chart: Year-wise temperature trends (2013–2022)
Bar Graph: Average annual rainfall comparison
Scatter Plot: Max Temperature vs Humidity
Correlation Heatmap: Relationships between weather features

✅ Predictive Modeling
Trained Linear Regression to forecast max temperature
Evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² score
Visualized actual vs predicted temperature with regression line

Dataset: Kaggle - Bangladesh Weather Data.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apurboshahidshawon/weatherdatabangladesh) 


📌 Expected Output
🔹 Line Chart: A temperature trend graph over the years, showing how climate has changed over time. 
🔹 Bar Graph: Yearly rainfall comparison to analyze precipitation patterns. 
🔹 Scatter Plot: A graphical relationship between humidity and temperature. 
🔹 Temperature Prediction Graph: A Linear Regression model forecasting future temperature changes, visualized in an orange trend line. 
🔹 Statistical Summary: The console will display key climate insights.
